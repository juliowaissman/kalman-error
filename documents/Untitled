\section{The climate deviation model strategy}

Let $P_{ij}(t)$ and $L_{ij}(t) the observed precipitation and lighting gaussian counts in grid $i,j$ at time $t$ respectively. The aim of the model is to estimate the precipitation $\hat{P}_ij(t) using the lightning data of the grid and the grids in a neighborhood in space and time. The $\hat{P}_ij(t)$ is estimated in two stage: a frist stage using a linear invariant seasonal model adjusted by a least square methodology and a climate deviation model adjusted in dynamical way by means of a Kalman filter.
